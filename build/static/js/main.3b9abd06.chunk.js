Real-time Operating Systems",description:"\n          This course covered the fundamentals of operating systems, particularly real-time as you can guess from the\n          course title. There was a lot of content to take in, such as memory allocation and management, multi-threading\n          and multi-processing, caching and I/O, but no memorization was required as the assessments were open-book.\n          Each lab involved the creation of a particular aspect of an operating system written in the C language\n          that would run on the ARM-based Keil MCB1700 microprocessor.\n        "},{title:"ECE356 Database Systems",description:"\n            This course covered the fundamentals of databases including ER modelling, SQL queries, relational algebra,\n            transactions, basic data warehousing and mining, concurrency and recovery. There were four labs done in MySQL,\n            with the first one completed individually and the other three completed in groups of three. The final lab combined\n            our knowledge of MySQL as well as some basic SciKit-learn APIs to predict whether a particular baseball player\n            would be in the MLB Baseball Hall-of-Fame given their play stats. Overall, the breadth of knowledge covered was great,\n            but the depth was lacking.\n          "},{title:"ECE358 Computer Networks",description:"\n            This course covered the fundamentals of computer networks, particularly of each layer in the OSI model other than\n            the application and physical layers. For the longest time, I have been working as a software developer writing APIs\n            on the back-end and calling them on the front-end but I didn't have a complete grasp of how these APIs were sent\n            over computer networks. This course gave me that valuable knowledge, and I would be lying if I said that I\n            didn't enjoy the content!\n          "}]},{term:"3A",title:"Crossing Into Uncharted Territories",description:null,courses:[{title:"ECE306 Probability Theory and Statistics",description:""},{title:"ECE327 Digital Systems Engineering",description:""},{title:"ECE351 Compilers",description:"\n          This course covered the fundamentals of compiler design and implementation. It started off with a recap\n          of finite automata and grammar from ECE208 (discrete mathematics and logic). Then, we learnt how to apply\n          those abstract knowledge to create and optimize various aspects of a compiler, including recursive descent\n          parsing, compile-time optimizations, register allocation and garbage collection. Through the labs, I slowly\n          but gradually applied my newfound knowledge of compilers to build a simple yet capable compiler in Java\n          to convert Java code to a subset of the VHDL language to, finally, Assembly.

After the next co-op term, I'll be half way through the ECE program.\n      I still have no regret about choosing ECE as both my hardware and software courses so far\n      have been exciting and interesting. With most of the foundational courses cleared up, I do\n      expect that the courses from here on out will be more practical, so I will be able to\n      better see how what I have learnt so far can be applied to real-life situations. As for\n      the 2B term itself, the content was not particularly difficult.

With 6 courses, I essentially spent half of my day\n      every weekday of the week on campus in a lecture, tutorial or lab... and that's on top of completing\n      assignments, working on side projects, and preparing for co-op interviews. All in all, relaxation was mostly\n      a weekend thing. Unfortunately, I only realized the great extent of my procrastination after midterm week,\n      which saw my marks dip significantly from first year.

On the other hand, with mathematics\n      (both discrete and continuous), circuits, digital logic  and E&M courses all bundled into 1B, this term\n      has clearly established itself as a more ECE-specific foundational term. I have so many opinions regarding\n      each course, but I doubt anyone would want to hear my rants, so I\'m going to summarize my opinions.\n      I put in the most effort into circuits and felt it was easy  after doing so many problem sets. This effort\n      paid off as I scored 100% in that course. Meanwhile, digital logic was difficult even after completing the\n      problem sets since it required covered tons of content so quickly and a lot more memorization and out-of-the-box\n      critical thinking. However, the course made me approach  problems with a more "hardware" mindset; for example,\n      breaking down problems into state machines, with the consideration of transitions and assignments across various\n      clock cycles. The difficulty of all of the other courses would somewhere between the two aforementioned courses,\n      but they were about equally as useful to me.\n    ',courses:null},{term:"1A",title:"The Beginning of a New Age",description:null,courses:null}],Ue=function(){return Object(B.jsxs)(W,{id:"academics",children:[Object(B.jsx)(U.a,{as:"h2",children:"Academics"}),Object(B.jsx)(ce.a,{inverted:!0,children:Object(B.jsx)(Fe.a.Group,{size:"small",inverted:!0,children:Be.map((function(e){return Object(B.jsx)(Je.a,{trigger:Object(B.jsxs)(Fe.a,{children:[Object(B.jsx)(Fe.a.Value,{children:e.value}),Object(B.jsx)(Fe.a.Label,{children:e.label})]},e.key),content:e.description,position:"top center"},"academic-popup-".concat(e.key))}))})}),Le.map((function(e,t){return Object(B.jsx)(Ne,Object(A.a)({},e),"academic-card-".concat(t))}))]})},We=Object(I.a)(P.a)(ye||(ye=Object(v.a)(["\n  position: fixed;\n  bottom: 8px;\n  right: 8px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n"]))),Ge=function(){var e=Object(f.useState)(window.scrollX),t=Object(we.a)(e,2),n=t[0],a=t[1];return Object(f.useEffect)((function(){var e=function(e){a(e.target.documentElement.scrollTop)};return window.addEventListener("scroll",e),function(){return window.removeEventListener("scroll",e)}}),[n]),n>80?Object(B.jsx)(We,{name:"arrow alternate circle up",size:"huge",onClick:function(){return window.scrollTo({top:0,behavior:"smooth"})}}):Object(B.jsx)(B.Fragment,{children:" "})};var _e=function(){return Object(B.jsxs)(B.Fragment,{children:[Object(B.jsx)(Pe,{}),Object(B.jsxs)("main",{children:[Object(B.jsxs)(T,{children:[Object(B.jsx)(Oe,{}),Object(B.jsx)(w.a,{}),Object(B.jsx)(Me,{}),Object(B.jsx)(w.a,{}),Object(B.jsx)(Z,{}),Object(B.jsx)(w.a,{}),Object(B.jsx)(_,{}),Object(B.jsx)(w.a,{}),Object(B.jsx)(Ue,{})]}),Object(B.jsx)(Ge,{})]})]})},He=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&n.e(3).then(n.bind(null,178)).then((function(t){var n=t.getCLS,a=t.getFID,i=t.getFCP,o=t.getLCP,r=t.getTTFB;n(e),a(e),i(e),o(e),r(e)}))};n(145);O.a.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(Object(B.jsx)(y.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(B.jsx)(_e,{})})),He()}},[[146,1,2]]]);
