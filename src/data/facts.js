    I used to play chess semi-competitively in high school. However, I stopped playing for a while
    once I got to university, but I now play it again but this time only casually against bots
    and in puzzles on chess.com. I don't really have a favorite opening but I usually play the
    Ruy Lopez or Scotch opening, some variation of the four knights opening (classic
    beginner's opening) or if I'm playing black, the sicilian defense. I would count myself as a
    pretty aggressive player albeit a slow one.

    Surprisingly, I was good at drawing when I was a child. I won a few drawing contests, and 
    most of my works were based on still life. Some contests were serious; others
    were just for fun. The most notable contest that I entered was a Club Penguin (RIP that game)
    event, which won me an exclusive Club Penguin plushie.
